# ECG-FIR-filtering
The task of this assignment is to filter an ECG with FIR filters and to detect the ‘R’
peaks. In contrast to the FFT assignment, I write filter code which can be used
for realtime processing. This means that the FIR filter needs to be implemented
with the help of delay lines and the impulse response is truncated.
